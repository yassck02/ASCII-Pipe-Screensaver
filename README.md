### Build + Run
This project uses the ncurses library. ncurses is most commonly used for rendering text based user interfaces in command line environments. In this project, it is used for rendering the pipes to the terminal window. To build the project, link it with the ncurses library. Mac OS and most Linux distributions already come with ncurses installed, but Windows users will need to install it themselves
```
g++ main.cpp -lncurses
```
